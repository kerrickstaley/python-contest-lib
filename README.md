# python-contest-lib
Python 3 library for coding contests (Google Code Jam, ICPC, etc.)

This is a direct Python 3 port of the C++ code in https://github.com/atmorgan/ICPC2014 .
All credit for the design of the algorithms and tests goes to the authors of that repository. I just ported it to Python.

This is a work-in-progress and will probably never be fully complete; I just port things as I need them. PRs welcome.
